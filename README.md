* Applications

    -   This project will consist of a HTML page that displays a piano. When the user presses a specific key, or clicks the object, a
        sound will play corresponding to the event. Below the piano will be a list of sliders, knobs, and other options that will 
        adjust the settings and output of the music. 

    -   Along with the piano, there will be an option for the user to choose genres and specific songs pulled from an
        API so that the user can follow along with the music to practice their skills.
